# Session Zero
Before diving in and starting the game, it is highly encouraged that the Dungeon Master host an expectations-setting session.
Calling it a session may be a bit of a misnomer, because as *the AngryGM* describes it, this is more of a conversation.
For more information about what you should expect from Session Zero, [read his guide about it][AngryGM].
While this module sets certain expectations for you, others are left open-ended; this article helps fill in those gaps.

## Angry CliffNotes
What to tell your group about session zero:
1. Session zero is about the campaign.
1. You want to build the game with their input.
1. There won't be character generation yet until after session zero.
	*Do not allow your players to make characters before this.*

Core engagements to watch for:
- Challenge
- Discovery
- Expression
- Fantasy
- Fellowship
- Narrative
- Sensory Pleasure
- Submission

How to structure your session zero:
1. Dinner; no conversation about the game allowed.
1. Establish a firm DM's fiat about the game:
	- expectations about attendance (*eg* you don't show up, you don't get exp)
	- changes to the base rules (*eg* long rests take 7 days, short rests 7 hours)
	- character concept restrictions (*eg* no evil or selfish characters)
1. Get people talking by assertively asking open-ended questions about popular culture.
1. Stop talking and withdraw &mdash; take notes while conversation ensues.
	- identify and note core engagements
	- steer the conversation when it stagnates
	- end the conversation when it seems enough
1. Consult your notes when wrapping up; ask about interest in core engagements.
	- don't do so directly, instead bounce it off pop culture
1. Recap session zero (overview of what happened points 1&ndash;5)
