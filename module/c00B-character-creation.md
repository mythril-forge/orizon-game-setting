# Character Creation
Once you finish reconnaissance on your players' key engagements and favored themes, its time to give them the lay of the land.
Give them this [introductory handout][h00], or read it aloud during the start of the session.
The foundation of the story is, of course, already done for you&hellip;but its up to you to personalize it!
There will be plenty of opportunity to inject the points discussed in session zero.
That said, it is time to focus on the matter at hand: character creation.

## Setting Expectations
As with session zero, character creation should come with some expectations:
1. Character creation is a 2-hour session which deals with your characters' bonds with the world around them.
1. There won't be character generation until you are instructed to do so.
	*Do not allow your players to make characters before this session.*
1. You will be starting your character at level 0, with no class, and no background.
	You can pencil those features in once you earn them.

You, as the DM, know everything there is to know about the world.
Be sure to answer questions as they are asked, for this session is fairly loose and involves players working together to form a "family".
