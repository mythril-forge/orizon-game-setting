# Introduction
In this module, you will be exploring the vast planet of Orizon, and all that it has to offer.
The most important thing you must know is that Orizon features skyborn, floating islands.
These masses of land stay afloat due to a powerful arcane crystal known as ætherium.
These islands would collapse without them.

## Coming Together
Due to the nature of this story, the players are suggested to agree that their characters are a sort of family.
For the best possible experience, the DM and players starting this module must work together to forge the characters' backstory and relationships early on.

Two or more player characters are recommended to be siblings; the youthful (less than 25 years old) descendants of a loving human grandmother by the name of **Mabel Longriver**.
The original parents of these children passed away in a tragic fall too early in their life.

Of course, some players may not wish to play human characters.
In this case, the parents (*and even Mabel herself*) have a soft spot for orphans, and would have gladly adopted in some of the less fortunate as honorary members of the Longriver family.

Even then, other players may not wish to play youthful characters.
If this happens, Mabel could hire fair and loyal labor in exchange for modest pay, a roof to sleep under, and a seat at the dinner table.
After all, she is becoming too elderly to take care of everything herself.
With time on this farm, this character could have been profoundly impacted by watching Mabel's grandchildren grow up.

### The Southwind Farm &amp; Estate
Miss Longriver owns the Southwind Farm &amp; Estate and tends to its needs, alongside the player characters.
The estate itself is located on a secluded skyborn archipelago.
Just one of these flying isles is large and sturdy enough to support a few buildings, a fishery, and a farm.

The estate itself is four acres wide, and has a main house, a guest house, a windmill, and two storage sheds.
One of the predominant features on this isle is a large, self-generating freshwater lake housing a supple fishery.
The source of the water is a crystal at the bottom of the lake that spouts water indefinitely.

An entity called the Great Empire has dominion over this region, and asserts their laws and taxes on the estate.
That said, the farm property is in Mabel Longriver's name, and she manages its business endeavors within the family.
To that end, Mabel knows just how privileged her family is.

The future generation of the Longriver family as it stands has been living peacefully on this land for about three decades now.
However, Miss Longriver knows that it will soon be time to pass on the estate and let the children flourish into the world at large.

### Growing Up on the Estate
The player characters should mostly look fondly and sentimentally upon their childhood on the estate.
Mabel Longriver would go through great lengths to raise her grandchildren.
She instilled a work ethic through farm labor and business practice.
She would hire educational experts to come and train the children to read, wield a sword, or practice magic.
Sometimes, she would take the children on vacations to see vast cities and grasslands, telling great stories of their history.
Most of all, Miss Longriver spoiled her grandchildren, and tried her very hardest to make each of them as happy as they could be.

Nevertheless, there is only so much that one can do on a secluded stretch of four acres.
Every inch of that estate has been traveled a thousand times over by its inhabitants.
By now, the player characters must start to have some sort of anxiety living on this mote of land, perhaps claustrophobia, or just plain boredom.

Whatever the case, the Longriver family lives a lonely, naïve, and innocent life, affording a great deal of comfort.

## Creating Your Character
The above passage is the base of your backstory.
At this point in the game, the details of your backstory is most important.
Consider a fond memory that you might have had with one of the other player characters.

Now, follow this character generation method:
1. Pick your fantasy race and subrace.
1. Generate your ability scores as normal.
1. Describe your character.

Skip the other character generation steps; you will begin without choosing a class or background.
Your character is level zero.
Your hit point maximum starts at exactly `10`.
Start only with the features given by your fantasy race.
You will keep these hit points as a bonus when you earn your first level.

Do not worry about these changes; you will end your first session by choosing your background and first class level.
At that point, you can follow these steps to finish your character:
1. Pick your character class.
1. Choose your background.
